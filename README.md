What you can do with this project:
* Send ETH (approximately $50 worth of Ethereum) to the Smart Contract Wallet
* Get the balance of the Smart Contract
* Test ETH are required. Specifically, GOERLY TESTNET TOKENS!!
* Withdrawl of funds, but these can only be called by the smart contract deployer address
